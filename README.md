Note from the author: 
You have permission to use any part of the QuickFigures project. 
I don't expect much more than recognition and thanks. 
It is primarily for academic use by researchers at scientific institutions. In the event
that it takes off with incredible popularity, I might need to start making many improvements and
possibly start asking for help. 
Furthermore, I would be flattered if parts of my work were re-used or repurposed by others.
I am currently pushing recent changes to this repository.
The sourcecode for my journal submission is in the QuickFigures.zip file while 
the .jar file can be used as an ImageJ plugin.

Please feel free to contact me with any bug reports, questions, recommendations or comments.

Enjoy the toolset,
Gregory 

PS: Some of the source code does not follow ordinary conventions for naming and explanations 
for how my code works are not always detailed. If you want to re-use parts of my code in your software
it may be helpful to contact me.
